        <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
        <p>
          I've found that the first few months of any working relationship involve a lot of unnecessary friction: figuring out how someone operates, what they value, where they're flexible and where they're not. This document is meant to compress that learning curve.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's also a tool for holding myself accountable. Writing down how I want to work makes it harder to drift from it. If you see a gap between what's here and what I'm actually doing, call it out.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Disclaimer: This applies only to me. Other managers operate differently.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          I work directly with Product, Design, and Research teams. At the core, my job is to help us build things that actually work for real people: products that capture value for the business while genuinely solving problems for users. That said, shipping products is only part of the job.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other part is building the team: creating reliable processes that scale, mentoring people to expand their leadership capacity, establishing clear success criteria, and making sure individual growth aligns with what the organization needs. I think of it as tending to two systems simultaneously: the product system and the people system. Both need attention; neglect either and the whole thing drifts.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>One on Ones:</strong> I structure these as 10-10-10: ten minutes for your priorities, ten for mine, ten for future planning. The focus is development and well-being, not status updates. If you need to report status, there are better async mechanisms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Feedback:</strong> Timely and honest. Critical feedback happens privately; praise happens publicly. I don't store up feedback for quarterly reviews. If something needs to be said, I'll say it soon. I expect the same from you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Coaching and Delegation:</strong> I invest in development because it compounds — better people build better products, and the organization's capacity expands. The question I keep coming back to: "What happens if we don't invest in people, and they stay?"
        </p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Leadership from everywhere.</strong> You don't need to be a manager to lead. I expect people to take ownership of problems regardless of title or reporting structure. If something needs to be done, do it or escalate it. Don't wait for permission.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Action over debate.</strong> Starting and learning beats endless planning. I'd rather ship something imperfect and iterate than spend weeks getting alignment on a spec. That said, some decisions warrant more deliberation; judgment about which is which matters.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Extreme ownership.</strong> Problems get solved, not passed around. If something breaks, we fix it and figure out how to prevent it. Blame-shifting is a signal that the culture needs work.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Positive intent.</strong> Assume good faith until proven otherwise. Most miscommunication comes from context gaps, not bad actors. Start there.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Systems thinking.</strong> I tend to break complex problems into flowcharts and processes. If I can't map it, I probably don't understand it yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Service orientation.</strong> I serve you, not the other way around. My job is to remove obstacles, provide context, and create conditions where you can do your best work.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Continual small fixes.</strong> I believe in the compounding power of continually fixing small things. Quality is everyone's responsibility, and there are always improvements to be made.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Work with Me</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Tell me early if something's off.</strong> Bad news doesn't improve with age. I'd rather hear about a problem when it's small than when it's a crisis.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Bring problems and your thinking on solutions.</strong> I don't expect you to have the answer, but I do expect you to have thought about it. "Here's what's broken and here's what I've considered" is more useful than "here's what's broken."
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Push back when you disagree.</strong> I have opinions, but I'm not always right. If you think I'm missing something, say so. I'd rather have the argument now than discover the blind spot later.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Be honest about capacity.</strong> Overcommitting helps no one. If the workload isn't sustainable, flag it. We'll figure out what to deprioritize together.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>
          I move fast, sometimes too fast. The thing I'm actively working on is slowing down to bring people along: making sure context gets shared, not just decisions. I also notice my impatience with process-for-process's-sake. Not all process is waste, but not all process serves purpose either.
