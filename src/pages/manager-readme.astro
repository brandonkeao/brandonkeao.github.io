        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p>
          This document outlines my approach to leadership, collaborating, getting things done, and enjoying work. This document is meant to help us work well together to our mutual benefit. This document is a tool to help keep me accountable to my values.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          This document applies only to me, and in no way should be considered to apply to any other manager, team, or organization.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          As a Product leader, I generally oversee and work directly with Product, Design, and Research teams. My mission is to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deliver and manage products that <strong>capture customer value</strong></li>
          <li>Deliver and manage products that <strong>surprise and delight users</strong></li>
          <li>Iterate on reliable processes that build a scalable organization and business</li>
          <li>Mentor individual contributors and managers to increase leadership capacity</li>
          <li>Retain talent through genuine care and a strong team culture</li>
          <li>Establish clear success criteria for individuals and their teams</li>
          <li>Align professional growth with organizational objectives and personal career objectives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>One on Ones:</strong> Weekly 30-minute sessions with structure: 10 minutes for your priorities, 10 minutes for my needs, and 10 minutes for future planning. These focus on development and well-being rather than status updates.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Feedback:</strong> "Timely, honest feedback drives growth." Critical feedback occurs privately; praise happens publicly.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Coaching and Delegation:</strong> Development benefits both individual careers and organizational growth, guided by: "What happens if we don't invest in people, and they stay?"
        </p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Leadership from everywhere (non-managers lead through alternative structures)</li>
          <li>Action bias (starting and learning beats endless debate)</li>
          <li>Extreme ownership (teams solving their own problems without blame-shifting)</li>
          <li>Positive intent (assuming good faith from all parties)</li>
          <li>Systems thinking (breaking complexity into flowcharts and processes)</li>
          <li>Continuous improvement (compounding benefits from small fixes)</li>
          <li>Service orientation: "I serve you, not the other way around"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Work with Me</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Tell me early if something's off</li>
          <li>Bring problems <em>and</em> your thinking on solutions</li>
          <li>Push back when you disagree</li>
          <li>Be honest about capacity and priorities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>
          I tend to move fast and skip steps, working on slowing down to bring people along. I also recognize impatience with process for process's sake, focusing on recognizing when process serves purpose.
