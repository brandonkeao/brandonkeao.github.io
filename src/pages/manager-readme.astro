            This is how I work with teams. It's meant as a practical guide for anyone who reports to me, works alongside me, or is considering collaborating. I update it as I learn -- it's a living document, not a static manifesto.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my opinion, the best working relationships start with clarity on expectations, values, and operating style. This is my attempt at that clarity.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          As a Product leader overseeing Product, Design, and Research teams, my mission encompasses:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delivering products that capture customer value and delight users</li>
          <li>Building scalable, reliable organizational processes</li>
          <li>Mentoring contributors and managers to expand leadership capacity</li>
          <li>Retaining talent through genuine care and strong team culture</li>
          <li>Establishing clear success criteria individually and collectively</li>
          <li>Aligning professional growth with both organizational and personal career objectives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <h3>One on Ones</h3>
        <p>
          Weekly 30-minute sessions structured as: 10 minutes for your priorities, 10 minutes for my needs, and 10 minutes for future planning. These focus on development and well-being rather than status updates.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Timely, honest feedback drives growth. I deliver feedback immediately and expect reciprocal candor. Critical feedback occurs privately; praise happens publicly.
        </p>

        <h3>Coaching and Delegation</h3>
        <p>
          Development benefits both individual careers and organizational growth. I live by the principle: "What happens if we don't invest in people, and they stay?"
        </p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>

        <p><strong>Leadership from everywhere.</strong> Non-managers lead through alternative structures beyond traditional hierarchy.</p>

        <p><strong>Action bias.</strong> Starting and learning beats endless debate.</p>

        <p><strong>Extreme ownership.</strong> Teams solving their own problems without blame-shifting.</p>

        <p><strong>Positive intent.</strong> Assuming good faith from all parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Systems thinking.</strong> Breaking complexity into flowcharts and interconnected processes.</p>

        <p><strong>Continuous improvement.</strong> Compounding benefits from fixing small inefficiencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Service orientation.</strong> "I serve you, not the other way around."</p>

        <h2>How to Work with Me</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Tell me early if something's off -- project, role, anything</li>
          <li>Bring me problems <em>and</em> your thinking on solutions</li>
          <li>Push back when you disagree. I change my mind when presented with better information</li>
          <li>Be honest about capacity and priorities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
        <p>
          I tend to move fast and sometimes skip steps. I'm working on slowing down to bring people along.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can be impatient with process for process's sake. I'm working on recognizing when process serves a purpose.
