          <!-- Section 1: Lead with Product/Leadership -->
          <p class="lead mb-10">
            I've spent 18+ years building products, leading teams, and designing systems that work for real people in real organizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            From early-stage startups figuring out what to build, to scaling companies optimizing what they've built, to enterprise organizations trying to remember why they built it in the first place; I've seen the full cycle. User research. Product strategy. Design systems. Team development. The messy reality of shipping things that matter.
          </p>

          <p>
            I care about things that actually work. Not features for the sake of roadmap completeness. Not technology for the sake of appearing innovative. Useful tools that solve real problems for real people.
          </p>

          <p>
            That said, building useful things requires more than good intentions. It requires understanding systems: how information flows, how decisions get made, how teams coordinate under uncertainty. Product work, at its core, is systems design.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 2: Bridge to AI -->
          <h2>The AI Chapter</h2>

          <p>
            Like many of us in Tech, I've been diving deeper and deeper into AI. The biggest shift for me was moving from chat web interfaces to the command line, first with Amazon Q and then with Claude Code + Cursor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Models keep getting better and while it's hard to believe, we should expect this to continue. Now that I am fully leveraging Claude Code for all my Personal and Professional workflows, it's becoming clear where the new friction areas will be. The bottlenecks are elsewhere now: context engineering, memory management, the interplay between memory surfaces and control surfaces, the coordination patterns that make agentic systems actually work.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is where product thinking meets AI engineering. Designing how information flows to AI systems. Structuring context so it's useful, not just available. Building the scaffolding that enables real collaboration between humans and AI within teams and organizations. This is context engineering. Prompts are just the interface; context is the substance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eighteen years of thinking about user needs, information architecture, and system design prepared me for this in ways I didn't expect.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 3: Current Building -->
          <h2>What I'm Building</h2>

          <p>
            I'm rebuilding how I manage all my workflows, from personal to professional, into an Agentic Ecosystem and Operating System. I am centering this around the concept that AI Agents and Human Operators together can produce amazing results, not just one or the other, and we need to rethink how systems operate to enable this at scale.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm centering my system around an AI Agent persona that helps to manage a team of Agents using many of the same techniques for non-deterministic AI Agents that we use for non-deterministic Humans: feedback, coaching, delegation, 1:1s, empowerment, quality controls, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond Agents specifically, I'm developing frameworks like Context Maps: structured approaches to giving AI systems the information they need to be genuinely helpful. Not theoretical frameworks. Working systems that I use every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Head of Product at Rebrandly, I lead product strategy and AI integration for the link management platform. The two worlds inform each other: what I learn building my Agentic Ecosystem shapes how I think about Rebrandly's AI approach, and what I learn at scale informs how I build my own systems.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 4: Philosophy -->
          <h2>Philosophy</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Build, don't speculate.</strong> The best insights come from making things. I learn by shipping.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Practical over theoretical.</strong> I care about what works in practice, not what sounds impressive in conference talks. The gap between AI demos and AI value is where the real work happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Evidence-based.</strong> Strong opinions, loosely held. Every assumption gets tested. When the evidence points in a different direction, I change course.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Start simple, iterate based on evidence.</strong> I've learned this the hard way. Phase 2 of my agent system was over-engineered; I built infrastructure for problems I didn't have yet. Phase 4 started with markdown files and grew from there. The simple version taught me what the complex version actually needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Build in public.</strong> The journey is the content. I share what's working, what's broken, and what I'm learning along the way. Not polished case studies written after the fact: real-time dispatches from the work itself.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 5: Personal -->
          <h2>Personal</h2>

          <p>
            I'm a husband and father. Hannah and I have two kids: Skyler (5) and Aiden (newborn). They provide constant perspective on what actually matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm building this agent ecosystem while navigating a 5-year-old who thinks bedtime is negotiable and a newborn who hasn't figured out day from night yet. That constraint forces focus. It demands that things actually work, not just look good in a demo.
          </p>

          <p>
            The binding constraint isn't building the system; it's sustaining it alongside actual life. That's a different kind of engineering problem.
          </p>

          <!-- Section 6: How I Work -->
          <h2>How I Work</h2>

          <p>
            I've written a Manager README that goes deeper on how I lead teams, give feedback, and think about professional development. If you're considering working with me, whether as a colleague, client, or collaborator, it's worth a read.
          </p>

          <p>
            The short version: I believe in extreme ownership, action over debate, and treating every person I work with as capable of leading from wherever they are. I serve my teams, not the other way around.
