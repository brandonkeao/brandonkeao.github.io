          I'm a product leader with 18+ years of experience, now focused on the intersection of product strategy and AI.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My career has spanned product management, design, and strategy across startups and enterprises. I've led teams, shipped products, and helped companies figure out what to build and how to build it well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common thread: I care about building things that actually work for people. Not features for the sake of features. Not technology for the sake of technology. Useful tools that solve real problems.
        </p>

        <h2>The AI Chapter</h2>
        <p>
          In late 2024, I dove deep into AI&mdash;not as an observer, but as a builder. I started with the question that matters: "How do I make AI genuinely useful for my work?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer wasn't prompt engineering. It was <strong>context engineering</strong>&mdash;giving AI systems the right information, structure, and understanding to be truly helpful. Prompts are just the interface. Context is the substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This led me to build Jane, an AI Chief of Staff, and develop frameworks like Context Maps that help AI systems work more like knowledgeable colleagues than clever chatbots.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build, don't speculate.</strong> The best insights come from making things. I learn by shipping.</li>
          <li><strong>Practical over theoretical.</strong> I care about what works, not what sounds impressive.</li>
          <li><strong>Evidence-based.</strong> Strong opinions, loosely held. Always testing assumptions.</li>
          <li><strong>Build in public.</strong> Share the journey, not just the destination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Leadership Style</h2>
