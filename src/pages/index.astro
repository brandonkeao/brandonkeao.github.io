    quote: "Brandon was a great partner during our time together at Bitly. He is a rare mix in successfully blending an openness-to-listen with authority in decision-making, a clarity of vision with a practical grounding in how to 'get it done.' Whilst we were moving incredibly quickly in maturing Customer Success in tandem, he was matching pace with helping redesign and reshape the core product offering, whilst ensuring the voice and needs of customers were front and center throughout.",

    quote: "I'm not sure if I was more impressed by his ability to break down business objectives into actionable technical requirements - or his ability to show true leadership when it came to owning the project, teams, and client relationship. Finding someone who is good at one of these is already difficult, so anyone who has worked with Product Managers can empathize with how rare it is to find someone who can do both well.",

In that time, Brandon cultivated the ability to both understand and deliver deep, complex technical solutions and discuss high level technical concepts in an efficient manner with leadership. A strong team member, team leader, and individual contributor, Brandon excelled in the variety of client cultures that we worked with.",
