            My day job is leading product at Rebrandly. My obsession is figuring out how AI changes how we work.
          </p>

          <p>
            For select engagements, where there's strong fit and I can genuinely help, I'm available for advisory and fractional leadership.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm not here to convince you AI matters; you already know that. I'm here to help you figure out what to do about it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>I take on 1-2 advisory relationships at a time.</strong> My full-time role means I'm selective about the work I take on outside of it. That's a feature, not a bug: it means every engagement gets real attention, and I only say yes when I can make a real difference.

            <p>
              A conversation to explore fit. No pitch, no obligation.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'll ask about your situation: what you're trying to accomplish, where you're stuck, how you're thinking about AI integration. You'll get a sense of how I approach these problems and whether my perspective is useful.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there's a clear fit, we'll talk about what working together could look like. If not, I'll try to point you toward resources that might help.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Honest assessment of whether I can actually help</li>
              <li>Context on how I think about AI strategy and product leadership</li>
              <li>Clarity on next steps (or not; that's okay too)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Video call, scheduled via Calendly</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">AI Strategy Advisory</h3>
          <p class="text-[var(--text-secondary)] mb-4">For executives exploring AI integration</p>

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              You know AI matters. You're past the "should we do something" phase and into "what exactly should we do and how." That's where I come in.
            </p>

            <p>
              This isn't about implementing ChatGPT or fine-tuning models. It's about context engineering: designing how information flows to and from AI systems. It's about understanding where AI creates real value in your specific business, and where it's just noise.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What this looks like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assessment of your current state and opportunities</li>
              <li>Roadmap grounded in your actual constraints (team, resources, timeline)</li>
              <li>Hands-on guidance on implementation approach</li>
              <li>Ongoing advisory as you execute</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Executives at growth-stage companies (Series B+)</li>
              <li>Product leaders building AI-enabled products</li>
              <li>Ops leaders exploring automation and workflow AI</li>
              <li>Teams that want practical application, not slides</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Typically 2-4 hours/month, structured around your priorities. Custom to your situation.</p>

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              For organizations that need product and AI strategy expertise on a sustained basis, but don't need (or can't justify) a full-time hire.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the deepest level of engagement. I embed with your team, understand your business, and help drive outcomes over months, not hours.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What this includes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strategic direction on product and AI integration</li>
              <li>Hands-on work with your team (not just advice from the side)</li>
              <li>Participation in key decisions and meetings</li>
              <li>Accountability for outcomes, not just deliverables</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Companies where product and AI strategy are intertwined</li>
              <li>Teams going through a transition (new AI initiative, product pivot, scaling challenges)</li>
              <li>Founders who want a senior partner, not a consultant</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Monthly retainer, typically 10-20 hours/month. Structured around what your business actually needs.</p>

        <div class="prose mb-12">
          <h2>Availability</h2>

          <p>
            I'm intentionally selective. Between my full-time role at Rebrandly and my own building work (Jane, Context Maps, all the stuff I share on LinkedIn), I have limited bandwidth for outside engagements.
          </p>

          <p>
            That constraint keeps me focused on the work where I can have the most impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Current availability:</strong> Open to 1 new engagement
          </p>

          <p>
            If you're exploring fit, let's start with a discovery conversation. If the timing doesn't work now, I'm happy to stay in touch.
