I purchased my first GoPro camera to document ski trips with friends. After two years of skiing, I wanted to capture memories from increasingly frequent mountain adventures.

## The PowPenguins

In March 2014, my friends and I wore matching penguin costumes while skiing in Telluride, Colorado. We filmed ourselves and quickly edited the footage using GoPro's free video editing software, uploading the result to YouTube.

## Unexpected Outreach

Shortly after posting, Beatriz, a User Generated Content Coordinator at GoPro, contacted me through YouTube. The company wanted to license my footage—an exciting validation for a first-time poster.

## The Real Marketing Strategy

Rather than traditional advertising, GoPro built its growth on tapping into users' desires for recognition. The company curates and repurposes user videos, sometimes converting them into commercials. This approach inspired both existing and prospective customers to create content.

## The Outcome

Though my video wasn't featured prominently, I received free camera mounts and negotiated gear rental for a second shoot. I became an advocate while GoPro obtained quality footage and community engagement—a mutually beneficial arrangement that defines modern user-driven marketing.
