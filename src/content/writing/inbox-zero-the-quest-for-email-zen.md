The concept of "Inbox Zero"—achieving zero unread emails—has transformed my approach to email management. My previous approach was overly complicated and unsustainable.

## Getting Things Done (GTD) Philosophy

David Allan's *Getting Things Done* transformed my organizational approach. However, my initial elaborate system using Remember the Milk eventually fell apart as the complexity proved difficult to maintain as a lasting habit.

## A Simpler Email System

Inspired by Hannah Gay's LinkedIn article on inbox management, I adopted a five-label system:

1. Action Needed
2. Reply Needed
3. Waiting For Response
4. Delete when done
5. Look at this

Gay emphasized that this streamlined method helped her feel "very zen with my inbox, and managing it keeps me on top of both personal and professional life."

## Boomerang Tool

To enhance the process, I use Boomerang, a Gmail plugin enabling emails to reappear at specified times, particularly useful for tracking responses.

## Takeaway

Success lies in simplicity combined with GTD principles, transforming email management into a sustainable habit.
