Product managers come from diverse professional backgrounds, but they share a common core competency.

## Executive Ability

Executive ability unifies all successful PMs. This encompasses both technical and interpersonal skills needed to guide teams toward delivering on product vision and implementing roadmaps. Product Managers function as "CEOs of their products," requiring project management expertise and leadership capabilities.

## Role Variability

There's significant variation in PM responsibilities across organizations. "Diverse interpretations regarding the product manager role are the norm" and job expectations can shift dramatically within short timeframes.

## Innovation as Core Function

Beyond execution, product managers serve as "primary drivers of innovation." This involves anticipating customer needs, developing monetization strategies, and leveraging executive ability to execute. As industry expert Shardul Mehta puts it: "Product innovation is about creating monetizable customer value."

## Product Ownership

PMs own their products' complete evolution from conception through execution, filling whatever gaps emerge along the way.
