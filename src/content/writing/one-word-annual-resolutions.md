Approximately 9% of people felt that they were successful in achieving their resolution in 2016. There's a simpler approach: selecting a single word to serve as an annual mantra.

## The One-Word Approach

Rather than making lengthy resolution lists, choose one word as a guiding theme. Some examples:

- **Star:** Creating an independent future
- **Focus:** Narrowing attention to meaningful priorities
- **Presence:** Full engagement with one's surroundings and companions
- **Connection:** Balancing relationship depth versus breadth

Other powerful words include Love, Rest, Integrity, Smile, Finish, Kindness, Joy, and Patience.

## My Choice: Discipline

For 2017, I selected "Discipline" as my word. After a productive 2016, I needed to combat procrastination and redirect time away from social media and passive activities toward meaningful accomplishments.

What single word might guide your upcoming year?
