When it comes to cold outbound sales calls, I've learned some facts and skills that have already shifted the way I will always look at the sales cycle.

## Cold Sales Stereotypes

For me, cold calling still conjures up images of telemarketers calling during dinner and blatantly stepping through a script. As someone just diving into sales, I feared becoming this sort of dreaded cold-caller. However, I'm quickly discovering that this is fundamentally just a poor sales practice. Any truly successful sales campaign aimed at driving organic revenue growth must be based in relationship building and come from authenticity and earned respect. Robotic speeches must be avoided.

## Arrows in Your Quiver

Canned sales scripts reek of inauthenticity. That said, there is still value in writing things down. You'll need to effortlessly match solutions to problems. Instead of canned paragraphs and decision trees, business development reps should arm themselves with loose phrases or sentences to be called on demand. These can be pulled organically during authentic conversation.

## Aim for a Target

Besides arming yourself with useful language, you must have a target. Each step in the sales cycle has a necessary outcome for advancing towards closing, and the first cold call is no exception. In every call, determine your objective and write down your primary and backup goals. Are you trying to obtain a valid email, get past a gatekeeper, or schedule a discovery call?

## First Shot

You must show respect from the opening moment. After your brief introduction, ask: "Did I catch you at a bad time?" This immediately demonstrates respect for your prospect's time and provides organic options to guide the conversation favorably.

## Earning the Right

Earning the right to advance to the next sales cycle step involves respect and authenticity. By listening to problems and matching them with solutions, you can become a trusted advisor rather than a script-reading machine. This trusted position makes closing to the next step the natural outcome.
