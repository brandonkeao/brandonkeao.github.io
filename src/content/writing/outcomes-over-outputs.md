Organizations can maximize value by prioritizing outcomes over outputs, as Melissa Perri argues in *Escaping the Build Trap*.

## The Problem

Many organizations operate with top-down structures that push predetermined features to development teams, rather than focusing on desired business results.

## Product-Led Organizations

Perri defines these as entities that "understand and organize around outcomes over outputs" through experimentation and iterative delivery. Management rewards learning and goal achievement while encouraging teams to stay connected with customers.

## The Product Kata Framework

This approach connects company vision to measurable outcomes through:

- **Strategic Intents:** Objectives paired with key results (similar to OKRs) that define desired outcomes
- **Product Initiatives:** Hypothetical "bets" starting with "we believe that by…" to explore potential solutions
- **Problem & Solution Exploration:** Establishing baseline data and running structured experiments to test hypotheses

Perri emphasizes falling in love with the "problem rather than the solution."

## Building Momentum

This transformation connects to Jim Collins' Flywheel concept—sustained, disciplined effort creates compounding results over time. Organizations must continually renew and improve components to maintain momentum.
